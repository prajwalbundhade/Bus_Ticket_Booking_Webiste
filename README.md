<h3>Project setup:</h3> To set up the project, we will need a web server with PHP support, such as 
Apache or Nginx. We will also need a MySQL database to store student information and 
placement queries. We may choose to set up your web server and database on a local 
development environment or on a remote server.

<h3>Development process:</h3> We likely used HTML and CSS for the front-end design, and PHP for the 
back-end functionality. We may have used a framework like Bootstrap or Materialize for the 
front-end design to make it responsive and user-friendly on different devices. For the back-end 
functionality, you may have used a PHP framework like CodeIgniter or Laravel to make the 
development process easier and more organized.

<h3>Database design:</h3> We will need to create a database schema to store student information and 
placement queries. We may choose to create two tables in your MySQL database

<h3>Testing:</h3> To ensure that our project is functioning properly, We should test it thoroughly. We
may choose to use automated testing tools to test the functionality of our website, as well as 
manual testing to ensure that the website is user-friendly and intuitive.

<h3>Deployment:</h3> Once our project is ready for deployment, we can choose to deploy it on a remote 
server or host it locally. we will need to configure your web server and database to ensure that 
our website runs smoothly.
